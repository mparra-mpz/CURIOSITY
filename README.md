CURIOSITY
=========

Repository for my first robotic project. The pythoncode , arduino sketchs and the documetation (UML diagram and eletronic diagrams) will be store on this repository. This project was developed using several software tools:

- Version Control: github (https://github.com/).
- Interface Develpment Enviroment: Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/).
- User Interface Framework: QT (http://qt-project.org/).
- Software Design: Visual Paradigm (http://www.visual-paradigm.com/).
- Electronic Design: Fritzing (http://fritzing.org/).
- Hardware Control: Arduino (http://www.arduino.cc/)
- Third Party Libraries: PyGame (http://www.pygame.org/)
- Third Party Libraries: PySide (http://qt-project.org/wiki/pyside/).

Thanks to all the people that works on this amazing projects.

The PYTHONPATH should be modified adding the  CONTROL class, for example you should type the following command before start the application (in the future a rpm should install and set the configurations necessaries in you computer):
export PYTHONPATH=~/git/CURIOSITY/CURIOSITY/src/control
